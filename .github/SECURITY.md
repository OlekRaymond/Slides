# Security Policy

As part of building slides, we **execute remote code** and therefore this code is **not secure** and should **not be used in production**. 

At a later date, code execution will be sandboxed as an **opt-in** setting.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Note we intentionally execute remote code, take this into account when reporting a vulnerability.
