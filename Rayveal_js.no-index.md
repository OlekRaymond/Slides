### Reveal.js

[Reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/) is a javascript framework that allows for presentations through code

It has code highlighting so is commonly used for code presentations.

Compiles slides into a static website so very portable.

### The Dream

I love Markdown, it's easy, dependable and I know it.

Instead of writing HTML presentations, I'd like to write things in markdown and have it all render nicely.

Reveal.js does have the ability to render markdown but if you use files, the resulting page is not static. ðŸ˜¢

So a step is required to go from Markdown files to slides.

[//]: # (Vertical slide)

Using PowerPoint or similar for code is challenging, no syntax highlighting and no suggestions to what works and doesn't

Rayveal Js attempts to build/run C++ and Python code, then colours the result green or red.
